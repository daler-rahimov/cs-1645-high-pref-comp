/**
 * 2. Write two C serial program that will sort 1,000 random integers located in main memory.
 * You will write two programs.  The first will do the sort in any way you want.  The second
 * will have you sort the first half and then the second half, and then merge the two.
 * You should use the same sorting method as you did for the first program.  Profile the sorting
 * code segments and determine which way is faster.  Is it always faster?  Be sure to also keep
 * track of fastest and slowest timesâ€” which are reflections of the fact that you are sharing the
 * machine with others.
