 * 1. Discover how to profile your program.  One potential way is to make use of gettimeofday.
 *   This will involve understanding that you are trying to time only a portion of your
 *   program and not the entire program.  Write a small program that will show how you can
 *   time a segment of your program.  Make the program such that it will let you do it many
 *   times and then produce an average of the result.
