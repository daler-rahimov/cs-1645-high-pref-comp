The data parallel word count takes about 0.207 seconds in avg. 
About 2 times faster than the serial word_count. 

All the data has been copied to the memory by the main thread and then 
data was divided between 4 thread. Some of the functions have been copied 
multiple times with different names in order to to increase performance. 
Since none of the thread have to waint to another to release a lock they 
can do more work. Only one mutex have been used.
